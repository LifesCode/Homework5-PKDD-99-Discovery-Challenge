# Homework5-PKDD-99-Discovery-Challenge
This project describes a bank that offers services to private customers. 
The services provided by the bank include account management, loan sanctioning, etc. 
The bank wants to improve its services. For example, bank managers have only a vague idea who is a good customer (whom to offer some additional services to) and who is a bad customer (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank's losses). Fortunately, the bank stores data about its customers, accounts (transactions over several months), loans already granted, credit cards issued. 
So bank managers hope to find some answers (and questions too) by analyzing this data.
