# Homework5-PKDD-99-Discovery-Challenge
This project describes a bank that offers services to private customers. 
The services provided by the bank include account management, loan sanctioning, etc. 
The bank wants to improve its services. For example, bank managers have only a vague idea who is a good customer (whom to offer some additional services to) and who is a bad customer (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank's losses). Fortunately, the bank stores data about its customers, accounts (transactions over several months), loans already granted, credit cards issued. 
So bank managers hope to find some answers (and questions too) by analyzing this data.

Solve comand:
By opening the comand prompt in this directory you can show the solution of each exercise via a specific comand.

"python main.py -s *exercise-name*" -> generic comand to show/execute the solution of a specific exercise

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help comand:
You can also get some information about the exercise with the comand:

"python main.py -h *exercise-name*" -> It will show the name and the task of the exercise



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Available exercises names:
These are the names to insert in the field *exercise-name* for both solve and help comands

Note: By running "python main.py -h" all these names will be shown

ch1-ex1    -> clean the database
ch1-ex2    -> define a problem to improve the bank's services
ch1-ex3    -> Show how Machine Learning can be used to solve this problem

ch2-ex1    -> Predict the average amount of money for an account
ch2-ex2-l1 -> Show which clients have credit cards
ch2-ex2-l2 -> Show which clients asked the bank for loans
